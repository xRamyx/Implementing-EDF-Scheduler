# Implementing-EDF-Scheduler-Based on FreeRTOS

Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.

## About

*   Implementing different tasks using the implemented EDF scheduler.
*   Verifying the system implementation by using analytical methods like URM and time demand analysis techniques and offline simulators like SimSo.
*   Dealing with trace macros and GPIOs to plot the execution of all tasks, tick, and the idle task on a logic analyzer.
